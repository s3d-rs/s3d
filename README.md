# The S3 Daemon

`s3d` is a daemon for data access using S3 API. A modern cousin of `nfsd`, `ftpd`, `httpd`, etc. It is designed to be simple, tiny, blazing fast, and portable in order to fit in a variety of environments from developer machines, containers, kubernetes, edge devices, etc.

By default, `s3d` serves the S3 API as a gateway to a main remote S3 storage (AWS/compatible), with ultimate protocol compatiblity (based on the AWS SDK and Smithy API), it adds critical features needed by remote clients such as queueing, caching, and synching, in order to optimize performance, increase data availability, and service continuity for its clients.

The need for a daemon running locally with client applications emerges in Edge computing use cases, where data is stored and processed locally at the edge as it gets collected, while some of the data gets synced to and from a main data storage (read more on [Wikipedia - Edge computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_computing)):

> Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and _data storage closer to the sources of data_.
> This is expected to improve response times and save bandwidth.

# Features

1. **S3 API**
   - Generated S3 protocol code with [awslabs/smithy-rs](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-rs) which builds the AWS SDK for Rust.
   - Provides compatible parsing of API operations, inputs, outputs, errors, and the server skeleton.
1. **WRITE QUEUE**
   - Writing new objects to local filesystem first to tolerate connection issues.
   - Pushing in the background to remote storage.
1. **READ CACHE**
   - Store cached and prefetched objects in local filesystem.
   - Reduce egress costs and latency of reads from remote storage.
1. **SYNC DIR**
   - Continuous, bidirectional and background sync of local dirs to remote buckets.
   - This is a simple way to get data that begins as local files to the remote S3 storage.
1. **FUSE MOUNT**
   - Virtual filesystem mountpoint provided by the daemon (see [kernel fuse docs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)).
   - The filesystem can be accessed normally for applications that do not use the S3 API.
1. **FILTERS**
   - Fine control over which objects to include/exclude for upload/cache/sync.
   - Filter by bucket name, bucket tags, object keys (or prefixes), object tags, and object meta-data.
   - Optional integration with [OpenPolicyAgent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) for advanced filtering.
1. **MONITORING**
   - Optional integration with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io).
   - Expose logging, metrics, and tracing of S3 operations and `s3d` features.

# Getting Started

The following snippet is a good starting point for getting started with `s3d`.

The [rust tools](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) are required for installing `s3d` from crates.io.

```bash
cargo install s3d # install latest from crates.io  (TODO: crate not published yet...)
s3d run           # runs daemon in foreground ...
s3d status        # check the daemon status
s3d status bucket/key     # check bucket or object status
s3d ls bucket/prefix      # list buckets or objects
s3d get bucket/key > file # get object data to stdout (meta-data to stderr)
s3d put bucket/key < file # put object data from stdin
s3d set bucket/key --tag s3d.upload=true --tag s3d.cache=pin # set tags for object
s3d help          # for more information
```
